The goal of this project is to complete the implementation of a hybrid network-on-chip (NoC) for a chip multiprocessor using an FPGA platform. The NoC combines packet-switched and circuit-switched communication and its components operate according to a latency-insensitive protocol. Some of the NoC building blocks will be provided. The project includes the development of a testing strategy for the NoC.
